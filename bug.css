The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you use it to calculate a value that results in a negative number, some browsers may not render the property correctly. For example, if you try to calculate the width of an element based on the parent's width minus another value that exceeds the parent's width, the result will be negative, and the browser may ignore the `calc()` property.
